## Protocol 
Protocol is a messaging app that translates languages in real time. For the first time, many people can communicate in different 
languages and each person will see all the messages translated in their own language automatically. 
Developed by J.D. Bean and Jeremy Gottfried. This project is unmaintained and is not seeking contributions at this time.
